Certainly! Here's a potential problem statement for a data science project:

**Problem Statement**: "Predicting Housing Prices in a Local Real Estate Market"

**Goal**: The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the selling prices of residential properties in a specific city or region based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, neighborhood, and other relevant factors.

**Why This Problem?**: This problem is a classic example of a real-world data science project that has practical applications. Accurate price predictions can be valuable for both homebuyers and sellers in making informed decisions. It's also a great project for learning and applying regression techniques in data science.

**Data Sources**: You can gather data for this project from various sources, including real estate websites, local government records, or publicly available datasets.

**Key Steps**:
1. Data Collection: Obtain and organize the data, ensuring it includes features like property details (e.g., square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms), neighborhood information, and actual sale prices.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the dataset, create visualizations to understand feature distributions, and identify any correlations between features and sale prices.

4. Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary, such as calculating the price per square foot or incorporating external data like neighborhood demographics.

5. Model Building: Train and evaluate regression models (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor) to predict housing prices.

6. Model Evaluation: Use appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error) to assess the model's performance.

7. Model Fine-Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters and potentially trying different algorithms.

8. Results Interpretation: Explain the model's predictions and highlight the most influential features affecting housing prices.

9. Documentation: Create a README file that explains the problem, data sources, methodology, and results. Include comments in your code for clarity.

10. Presentation: Develop visualizations and a report or presentation to effectively communicate your findings and model performance.

This project allows you to apply regression techniques, work with real-world data, and gain insights into a common problem people face when buying or selling homes. Plus, it's a valuable addition to your data science portfolio and resume.
