To find data for predicting housing prices in a local real estate market, you have several options:

1. **Public Datasets**: There are several public datasets available online that contain information about housing prices. Some of the popular sources include:

   - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets): Kaggle hosts various datasets related to housing and real estate. You can search for datasets by keywords like "housing" or "real estate."

   - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php): This repository provides various datasets that may include housing-related data.

   - [Zillow Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/): Zillow offers datasets related to real estate and housing trends.

2. **Government and Municipal Data**: Many local government websites provide data related to housing, property assessments, and sales. Check your city or region's official website or open data portal for such datasets.

3. **Web Scraping**: If you can't find suitable datasets, you can consider web scraping real estate websites like Zillow, Redfin, or Realtor.com. Be sure to review the website's terms of use and policies regarding web scraping.

4. **APIs**: Some real estate websites provide APIs that allow you to access housing data programmatically. For example, Zillow's API provides access to property details and pricing information.

5. **Data Generation**: If you're unable to find adequate data, you can simulate your own dataset by creating fictional housing data. While this won't be real-world data, it can be useful for practicing data science techniques.

When using external datasets, ensure that you follow any terms of use or licensing agreements associated with the data. It's essential to clean and preprocess the data to remove any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers before using it in your project.

For your project, you'll want data that includes features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location or neighborhood information, and the actual sale prices of the properties. The more comprehensive and clean your dataset, the better your model's predictions are likely to be.
